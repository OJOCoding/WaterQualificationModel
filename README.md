# Water Qualification Model

## Overview
The Water Qualification Model is a project designed to assess and classify water quality using advanced machine learning techniques. This model leverages data-driven methodologies to evaluate various water quality parameters, enabling efficient and accurate qualification of water for diverse applications.

## Features
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze water quality parameters.
- **Customizable Models:** Supports flexible configuration for various datasets.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed for scalability and adaptability to different use cases.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Provides detailed insights and classification of water quality.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks:**
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch (if applicable for deep learning)
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OJOCoding/WaterQualificationModel.git
   cd WaterQualificationModel
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
   - Ensure the dataset follows the required format (refer to `data/README.md` for details).

2. **Run the Model:**
   Execute the main script to train and evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Analyze Results:**
   - Outputs and results will be saved in the `outputs/` directory.
   - Visualizations and logs will be available for review.
